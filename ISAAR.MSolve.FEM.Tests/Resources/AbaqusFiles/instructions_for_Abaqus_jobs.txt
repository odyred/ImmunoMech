To run an Abaqus job from the myJob.inp file on Windows:

0) Make sure Abaqus is added to PATH:
	- Find the path where Abaqus is installed and the Commands subfolder.
		- For me it is C:\Program Files\SIMULIA\Abaqus\Commands
	- Open Control Panel\System and Security\System
	- Open Advanced System Settings
	- In the new window System Properties, open the Advanced tab and then Environmental Variables
	- In the new window Environmental Variables, from the list User variables for <username>, select Path and then press Edit
	- Depending on your Windows OS:
		- (Win10 and I think 8, 8.1) In the new window Edit environmental variable, press new and type or paste your Abaqus path. 
		- (Older Windows versions) Add your Abaqus path to the end of the PATH string. Separate it from the previous one using the character ;
		
1) Copy myJob.inp to a folder on your machine. 
	- DO NOT mess with the version of myJob.inp in the VisualStudio project's folders.
	- If you do mess with it by mistake, DO NOT commit the changes for God's sake.
	
2) Open command prompt in that folder:
	- In windows explorer, click on the folders path and select it all, if it isn't already.
	- Type: cmd
	- Alternatively, you could open the command prompt anywhere and change the directory, you masochist.
	
3) Run the job by entering: abaqus job=myJob
	- The .inp extension is not needed
	- If you rerun the job, make sure to enter: y , when prompted to overwrite the files.
