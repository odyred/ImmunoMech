# Solvers
This library is featuring linear algebra solvers for the solution of spatially and temporally discretized mechanics problems. In its core, it serves as a binding between the [LinearAlgebra](https://github.com/mgroupntua/linearalgebra) and the [MSolve.Core](https://github.com/mgroupntua/MSolve.Core) repos.

## Features

- **Assemblers:** Global matrix assemblers that take under consideration the connectivity of the underlying model supporting various formats including:
  * Dense
  * Compressed sparse row (CSR) (both symmetric and non-symmetric)
  * Skyline
  
- **Ordering:** Re-ordering strategies for the full matrices are supported for the minimization of matrix bandwidth 
  
- **Direct solvers:** Solvers that use factorization are implemented for dense, skyline and sparse formats

- **Iterative solvers:** Solvers that rely on "guessing" the solution by performing iterations are implemented, including the PCG and GMRES methods
  
- **Domain decomposition solvers:** Solvers that rely on the geometric and/or algebraic partitioning of the model at hand are implemented, including:
  * Overlapping methods: The Schwarz method is implemented
  * Dual methods: A series of variants of the FETI method are implemented
