# MSolve.MachineLearning
This library features machine learning algorithms for data analysis, statistical modelling, inference and pattern recognition. It uses the TensorFlow.NET and Microsoft.ML.TensorFlow.Redist NuGet packages.

## Features

- **Linear Regression:** Estimation of the optimal linear relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more independent variables using Least Squares Fitting. 

  
- **Neural Networks:** Estimation of a nonlinear relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a neural network.
