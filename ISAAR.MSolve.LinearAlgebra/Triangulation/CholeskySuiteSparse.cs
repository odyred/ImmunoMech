//TODO: SuiteSparse Common should be represented here by an IDisposable class SuiteSparseCommon.
//TODO: Perhaps I should express the back/forward/full solve using the L*D*L^T, L*L^T, L^T, L^T*D factors as in CHOLMOD.
//TODO: During a non linear or dynamic analysis the sparsity pattern stays the same. Perhaps the symbolic factorization phase 
//      (and anything else that depends only on the pattern) can be cached.
//TODO: the user should be able to choose a reordering algorithm or try them all, independently of the factorization. He could 
//      then use that reordering during other system solutions with the same dofs (e.g. during a non linear analysis). As it is
//      now, the option to try various reorderings is only possible during factorization. Thus, during each linear system 
//      solution, the rhs and solution vectors must be permuted and the same pattern must be processed to find a good reordering.
